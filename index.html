        <h3>My HTML schedule</h3>
        <p>Let me tell you:
            <br>... How I learned HTML.
            <br>... I made times to learn HTML. 
            <br>... Then I messed around with the commands of HTML. 
        </p>

        <h2>I am also planning to make a form with HTML.</h2>
        <p>I saw my brother making a fill out form on JavaScript.</p>
        <p>So I asked him "Can I make one?" He said I gotta graduate HTML and CSS.</p>
