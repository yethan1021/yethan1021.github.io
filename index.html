        <h2>I can do HTML now!</h2>
        <p>This is my first HTML project!</p>

        <h3>My HTML schedule</h3>
        <p>Let me tell you:
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... How I learned HTML.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... I made times to learn HTML. 
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... Then I messed around with the commands of HTML. 
        </p>

        <h2>I am also planning to make a form with HTML.</h2>
        <p>I saw my brother making a fill out form on JavaScript.</p>
        <p>So I asked him "Can I make one?" He said I <em> must learn HTML and CSS first</em>.</p>
